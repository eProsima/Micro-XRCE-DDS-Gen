*eProsima Micro XRCE* is a software solution which allows to communicate eXtremely Resource Constrained Environments (XRCEs) with an existing DDS network. This implementation complies with the specification proposal, "eXtremely Resource Constrained Environments DDS (DDS-XRCE)" submitted to the Object Management Group (OMG) consortium.

*Micro XRCE* implements a client-server protocol to enable resource-constrained devices (clients) to take part in DDS communications. *Micro XRCE Agent* (server) makes possible this communication. The *Micro XRCE Agent* acts on behalf of the *Micro XRCE Clients* and enables them to take part as DDS publishers and/or subscribers in the DDS Global Data Space.

*Micro XRCE* provides both, a plug and play *Micro XRCE Agent* and an API layer which allows you to implement your *Micro XRCE Clients*.
