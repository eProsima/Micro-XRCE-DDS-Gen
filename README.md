*eProsima Micro XRCE-DDS* is a software solution which allows to communicate eXtremely Resource Constrained Environments (XRCEs) with an existing DDS network.
 This implementation complies with the specification proposal, "eXtremely Resource Constrained Environments DDS (DDS-XRCE)" submitted to the Object Management Group (OMG) consortium.

The *Micro XRCE-DDS Gen* provides a tool for generate serialization topic code from an idl file using *Micro CDR* serialization library.
Although this tool is intended to be used with *Micro XRCE-DDS Client* library,
the code generated does not depend of it and can be used externally with the only dependence of *Micro CDR*, used for native serializations.
